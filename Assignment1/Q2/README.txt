To compile any case:
1. Run command on terminal :javac App_A.java (Case A)
                        or  javac App_B.java (Case B)
                        or  javac App_C.java (Case C)

To run any case:
1. Run command on terminal :java App_A (Case A) 
                        or  java App_B (Case B)
                        or  java App_C (Case C)
                        
After running the executable:
1. Enter simulation duration
2. Enter lambda
3. Enter mu

Then results will be printed on the console.

CAUTION:
* Theoritical results are only valid if lambda < 3*mu.
* Make sure that lambda is in the order of 0.0x so that inter arrival time is sufficiently large.
* Make sure that simulation time is large enough such that total passengers generated are large.
